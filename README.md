# Black-Friday-Consumer-Spending-Prediction


This project focuses on analyzing customer purchasing behavior during Black Friday sales using a real-world retail dataset. The goal is to build predictive models to estimate how much a customer is likely to spend based on demographic and product features. This project provides valuable insights into customer spending patterns, enabling businesses to tailor their marketing strategies and optimize revenue.

The dataset includes key information such as customer demographics (age, gender, occupation), product categories, and purchase amounts. The project involves several important steps:

Data Cleaning: Addressing missing values and handling outliers in the data.

Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA): Analyzing trends based on customer demographics and city categories.

Feature Engineering: Transforming and creating new features from existing data for better model performance.

Model Building: Training models including Linear Regression, Decision Trees, Random Forests, and XGBoost to predict customer purchase amounts.

Evaluation: Assessing model performance using metrics like Root Mean Square Error (RMSE).
